## Milestones

October 20th: Finalize milestones.
October 27th: Solidify working connection between Arduino and Processing sketches. Use demo Arduino sketches.
November 3rd: Abstract due. Implement music response poc (equalizer vs. flashing vs. modes, etc.). Circuit Playground used for microphone.
November 10th: Prototype due. Speech and voice recognition poc implemented. Can respond to at least one command by different users.
November 17th: Fit and finish due. Make music mode work for Arduino (not just Circuit Playground).
November 24th: Refined speech and voice recognition is implemented for Arduino with various command use.
November 29th: All code due. Use cases defined and other potential use cases added depending on progress (ex. turning on lights, fetching weather, etc.).
December 1st: Final presentation.
