Audio controlled light system

A system that responds to auditory input to control some light source. The system will take in auditory input, process for frequencies and amplitudes and translate this input into output for the light source. It will control both the state of the light (on vs. off) and the timing of said state. For example, a command input could cause the light to blink for 10 seconds. 

Our system could include various modes:
•	React to music: analyzing simply for frequency/amplitude changes
•	React to individuals’ voices: analyzing for patterns in frequency/amplitude changes based on pattern of specific individual’s
•	React to generic command types: analyzing for patterns in frequency/amplitude changes based on pattern of specific commands/sequences
